### This app uses JavaScript to generate its users a random password.

Upon clicking the generate password button, the user will be prompted to select a password length between 8 and 128, and to select which characters they want included in their password (i.e. lowercase, uppercase, numbers, & symbols).

The app will then generate a random password with the parameters given, and this password will appear in the text box on the screen.
